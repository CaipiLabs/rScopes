## rScopes What ?

ReScope is a flexible, effective and easy to use state management system inspired by ReactJS methods.

## What's the point ?

Applications transform structured data & events into user-friendly interfaces and controls. <br/>
The set of data transformations of one or more applications can be divided into reusable data components with a reactive state and result data.
Just like React Components. <br/>
Of course, that's quickly said, in an application, the data must deal with complex dependencies, different contexts, custom data bindings, and so on. <br/>

This is where reScope comes in: <br/>
It offers a simple, flexible and familiar structure to organize and synchronize your data components. <br/>
It manage theirs dependencies, theirs scopes, persitence, active instances & much more.
