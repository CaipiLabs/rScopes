## rScopes What ?

RS is a flexible state management system inspired by ReactJS methods.<br/>
Quickly said, RS allow linking, scoping, and sequencing of multiples redux-like, async-able, stores while remaining in a serializable flux architecture.


RS is semantically and operationally stable; it does the work and have a coherent semantic system. <br/>
That said, it wasn't wrote with perf as priority, but trying to get better code scalability & more intuitive usability. <br/>

## What's it like?

Here some conceptual basics :

```jsx harmony
import React    from "react";
import {withScope, withStateMap, asStore, asScope, asRef, Store} from "rscopes";

@withScope(
	{
	    @asStore
        CoffeeMachine:{
            coffee:100,
            sugar :100,
            
            // action
            makeCoffee:()=>(state)=>({
                coffee:state.coffee-1,
                sugar :state.sugar-1,
            })
        },
	    
	    @asScope
	    BrainScope:{
	            @asStore
        	    workMachine:{
        	    	cafeine:0,
        	    	work(){
        	    		this.$actions.$parent.makeCoffee()
        	    		return (state)=>({cafeine:state.cafeine+1});
        	    	},
        	    	// updating data basing the new state
        	    	$apply(data, {cafeine}){
        	    		return {
        	    			canWork:cafeine>=2
        	    		}
        	    	}
        	    },	
	    },
	    
	    @asStore
        Manager:{
	    	@asRef
            allOK:"BrainScope.workMachine.canWork",
            $apply(data, {allOK}){
                return {
                    allOK
                }
            }
        },
	    
        // add values & refs to existing store class
		@withStateMap({ hello: "rScopes" })
		test: Store
	}
)
@scopeToProps("Manager")
class TestProps extends React.Component {
	//...
}


```

### About decorators

( well, like code-decorators )

These are stage-0 decorators because while the decorators spec has changed and is now stage-2, no transpiler has yet to implement these changes and until they do, this library won't either. Although the TypeScript documentation uses the phrase "Decorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript" this is misleading because TypeScript still only implements the stage-0 version of the spec, which is very incompatible with stage-2 (as of this writing). If you concretely find that a compiler (babel, TS, etc) implement stage-2+, please do link me to the appropriate release notes! ðŸŽˆ


This can be consumed by any transpiler that supports stage-0 of the decorators spec, like [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) version 5. *Babel 6 [does not yet support decorators natively](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T2645), but you can include [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) or use the [`applyDecorators()` helper](#applydecorators-helper).*
