## What's react-scopes ?

RS is a simple to use & flexible state management system inspired by ReactJS methods.<br/>
Quickly said, RS allow linking, scoping, and sequencing multiples async-able stores while remaining in a serializable flux architecture.

RS Stores look like "React components for data".<br>
Basically, they render determined data according theirs current state & propagate these data to the listening stores state .<br>
We can "decorate" them, bind data from other stores & mutate theirs states.     

## Minimal doc [here](DOC.MD)

## Samples [here](https://github.com/rscopes/react-scopes-samples)

## Conceptual sample :

```jsx harmony
import React                                      from "react";
import RS,{asRef, asScope, asStore, withStateMap} from "react-scopes";
import {MyComplexStore}                           from "./from/somewhere";

// RS will instantiate a scope with each instance of this React Component
// it will inherit the scope & actions from the parents React Elements
@RS(
	{
		@asStore
		CoffeeMachine: {
			// all values here except functions are used as initial store value  
			coffee: 100,
			sugar : 100,
			
			// functions are registered as actions,
			// Actions return state mutation & can be call with props.$actions.*
			makeCoffee: () => ( state ) => ({
				coffee: state.coffee - 1,
				sugar : state.sugar - 1,
			})
		},
		
		// withStateMap hoc any Store to add values & refs to theirs state
		// this allow Store to be easily reused
		@withStateMap({
                            // refs can targets any store value in the scope
                            // when starting with "!" the store will not apply until the targeted value is !== undefined
                            @asRef
                            energy: "CoffeeMachine.coffee",
                            
			                goFetchTaskIn: "developement"
		              })
		ThingsTodo: MyComplexStore,
		
		// Scope can contain sub scopes
		@asScope
		BrainScope: {
			@asStore
			workMachine: {
				cafeine : 0,
				workerId: undefined,
				
				// refs can targets any store value in the scope
				// when starting with "!" the store will not apply until the targeted value is !== undefined
				@asRef
				subject: "!ThingsTodo.stuff",
				work() {
					
					return ( state ) => ({ cafeine: state.cafeine + 1 });
				},
				// the $apply fn update data basing the new state
				$apply( data, { cafeine }, changesInState ) {
					
					// recursions work: $apply must return same data to stop 
					this.$actions.$parent.makeCoffee()
					
					return {
						canWork: cafeine >= 2
					}
				}
			},
		},
		
		@asStore
		Manager: {
			// Connecting Manager will auto instantiate any referenced store 
			@asRef
			allOK          : "BrainScope.workMachine.canWork",
			@asRef
			stillHaveCoffee: "CoffeeMachine.coffee",
			$apply( data, { allOK, stillHaveCoffee } ) {
				if (!allOK && !stillHaveCoffee)
					{
						this.wait()// stop propagating 
						doBuyCoffee().then(
							data => this.release()// now it should have coffee
						)
					}
				return {
					allOK
				}
			}
		},
		
	}
)
// this will connect any changes of props.workerId to BrainScope.workMachine.workerId
@RS.fromProps("workerId:BrainScope.workMachine.workerId")
// this will bind the result data of Manager to props.Manager
// * Store are recursively instantiated when referenced & are destroyed when listeners are removed
@RS.connect("Manager")
class TestProps extends React.Component {
	//...
}

```

## Notes

RS seems semantically & functionally stable. <br/>
Also it's should be free of memory leaks.<br/>
<br/>
That's said RS was not written trying to be the faster/cleaner system one shot, but to :
- Have better scalability ( by making complex components independent )
- Easily define & reuse async data process 
- Make async SSR
- Avoid using tons of independents libs to manage the app state
- Easily serialize & restore full or partial app state
- etc

### About decorators

( well, like code-decorators )

These are stage-0 decorators because while the decorators spec has changed and is now stage-2, no transpiler has yet to implement these changes and until they do, this library won't either. Although the TypeScript documentation uses the phrase "Decorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript" this is misleading because TypeScript still only implements the stage-0 version of the spec, which is very incompatible with stage-2 (as of this writing). If you concretely find that a compiler (babel, TS, etc) implement stage-2+, please do link me to the appropriate release notes! ðŸŽˆ


This can be consumed by any transpiler that supports stage-0 of the decorators spec, like [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/) version 5. *Babel 6 [does not yet support decorators natively](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T2645), but you can include [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) or use the [`applyDecorators()` helper](#applydecorators-helper).*
